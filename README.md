# Power-Bi---Project
“Completed a hands-on Power BI project as part of a Udemy course, where I worked end-to-end with raw data—cleaning it in Power Query, building data models, creating custom DAX measures, and designing an interactive dashboard. The project demonstrates my ability to convert data into clear insights using visual storytelling and analytics.”
